# Krum Common Terraform Modules

## Purpose

The `common` directory contains a curated collection of Terraform modules specifically tailored for deploying cloud-native stacks. These modules have been designed to streamline the setup of cloud-native workshops, ensuring consistency, reusability, and rapid deployment across various scenarios and platforms.

## Overview

In the realm of cloud-native applications, a variety of tools and services are often required to ensure optimal performance, security, and scalability. Setting up these tools consistently across different environments can be a daunting task. The modules in this directory have been created to address this challenge by encapsulating best practices and common configurations.

### Key Features:

- **Modularity:** Each module serves a specific purpose and can be used in isolation or combined with others for more comprehensive setups.
  
- **Flexibility:** These modules are crafted to cater to both basic and advanced setups. Whether you're running a simple workshop or a complex multi-cloud scenario, there's likely a module here to fit your needs.
  
- **Consistency:** By using these modules, you ensure that every deployment adheres to the same standards and configurations, reducing errors and troubleshooting time.
  
- **Extensibility:** As cloud-native technologies evolve, so do our modules. They are designed to be extended and customized to fit new requirements and scenarios.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the desired module directory.
2. Follow the specific README (if available) or the provided documentation for that module.
3. Customize as per your requirements, and deploy.
